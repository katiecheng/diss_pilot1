    <p class="block-text"> In the following activity, you will see 20 Swahili words paired with their English translations. Then, you will be asked to study each pair either by (1) reviewing the Swahili-English word pair, or (2) trying to recall the English translation from memory. After you try both study strategies (review and recall), you will be asked to predict how well strategy worked for you. Finally, you will be quizzed on all 20 Swahili-English word pairs.
