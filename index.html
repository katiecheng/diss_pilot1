    <!-- Include my library, [mmturkey][mmturkey], which manages submitting data to Mechanical Turk. This defines a global object, <code>turk</code>, and attaches five properties to it, <code>hitId</code>, <code>assignmentId</code>, <code>workerId</code>, <code>previewMode</code>, and <code>turkSubmitTo</code>. It also provides a single method, <code>submit(data)</code>, which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), <code>submit</code> displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like <code>workerId</code> and <code>assignmentId</code>).  -->

    <p class="block-text">In the following activity, you will see 20 Swahili words paired with their English translations. Then, we will ask you to study each pair either by (1) reviewing the Swahili-English word pair, or (2) trying to recall the English translation from memory. After you try both study strategies (review and recall), we will ask you to predict how well strategy worked for you. Finally, we will quiz your memory of all 20 Swahili-English word pairs.

<!-- Include the <a href="experiment.html">JavaScript file for the experiment</a>. As written, that script immediately executes commands, so we include it here at the end of the HTML file to ensure that resources referenced by the script actually exist. For instance, one of the immediately executed commands is <code>showSlide("instructions")</code>. If we loaded experiment.js, say, in the <code>head</code> section, <code>showSlide("instructions")</code> would fail because the <code>instructions</code> slide doesn't exist yet. It is possible to load the script in <code>head</code> but you have to ensure that any immediately executed commands, if they rely on potentially uninitialized HTML elements, are _delayed_ until the page is ready, using either [window.onload][onload] or jQuery's more robust [$(document).ready()][domReady]  -->
