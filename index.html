  <!-- Include my library, [mmturkey][mmturkey], which manages submitting data to Mechanical Turk. This defines a global object, <code>turk</code>, and attaches five properties to it, <code>hitId</code>, <code>assignmentId</code>, <code>workerId</code>, <code>previewMode</code>, and <code>turkSubmitTo</code>. It also provides a single method, <code>submit(data)</code>, which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), <code>submit</code> displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like <code>workerId</code> and <code>assignmentId</code>).  -->

  <!-- Include the cascading style sheet (CSS), which lets us separate style from content. This stylesheet is important because it defines the notion of a **slide** and also makes things look nicer, which subjects appreciate. It's worth looking at the [source code](style.html). -->
