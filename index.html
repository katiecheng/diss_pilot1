  <!-- Include my library, [mmturkey][mmturkey], which manages submitting data to Mechanical Turk. This defines a global object, <code>turk</code>, and attaches five properties to it, <code>hitId</code>, <code>assignmentId</code>, <code>workerId</code>, <code>previewMode</code>, and <code>turkSubmitTo</code>. It also provides a single method, <code>submit(data)</code>, which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), <code>submit</code> displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like <code>workerId</code> and <code>assignmentId</code>).  -->

  <!-- Include the cascading style sheet (CSS), which lets us separate style from content. This stylesheet is important because it defines the notion of a **slide** and also makes things look nicer, which subjects appreciate. It's worth looking at the [source code](style.html). -->

    <p class="block-text"> In the following activity, you will see 20 Swahili words paired with their English translations. Then, we will ask you to study each pair either by (1) reviewing the Swahili-English word pair, or (2) trying to recall the English translation from memory. After you try both study strategies (review and recall), we will ask you to predict how well strategy worked for you. Finally, we will quiz your memory of all 20 Swahili-English word pairs.
